Levelling up my Car
--------------------

The idea here is that my Ford Focus is 2006 edition and quite shit.

So since we are builders, lets build something that would level it up. (stop all the other cars from laughing at it.)

So i propose building some functionality into a raspi that I will leave in the car and that will power up when the car turns on. 

LEVEL UP IDEAS:
	- build raspi to allow playing of audio through bluetooth or wifi to the car
		- rasp pi play audio to car
		- rasp pi accept BT
		- rasp pi accept WiFi
		- rasp pi channel audio through above to play audio
	- connect OBDII to raspi so we can mess with onboard car computer through connecting to raspi pi


========================
Getting the raspi setup:

enabled ssh access.
